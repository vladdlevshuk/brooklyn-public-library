# Brooklyn Public Library

## Project Description

Welcome to my first project, created during my enrollment in [RS School](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/library/library-draft.md) courses. This project represents the Brooklyn Public Library website.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Design:** The site is designed to be responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, ranging from 620 to 1440 pixels. It offers a seamless experience on tablets (768px resolution) and mobile devices (resolutions up to 640px).

- **Functionality:** The website is equipped with a number of useful features, including user authorization, limited carousel for themed content, block slider, modal windows, etc.

## Technologies and Tools

The project was brought to life using the following technologies and tools:

- **HTML5 and CSS3:** These technologies were employed for creating the layout and styling, ensuring a visually appealing and structured design.

- **JavaScript:** JavaScript was used to add interactivity and enhance the website's functionality.
